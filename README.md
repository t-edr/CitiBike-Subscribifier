# CitiBike-Subscribifier

This subscribifier analyzes public CitiBike monthly user data to try to predict whether a CitiBike user would be a subscriber or not based on variables such as gender and age. CitiBike Preprocessing.R simplifies and cleans the data for usability. KNN.py takes the derived data and performs the k-Nearest Neighbors NN algorithm to predict whether someone would be a Citibike subscriber or not based on gender, age, ride distance (miles), and ride duration (minutes).
